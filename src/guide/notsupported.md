# Not supported cases

MetaOffice Pro does not support some Microsoft Teams features. 

## Interact with someone has a guest on MetaOffice Pro

At present, MetaOffice Pro not support "guest" mode. We understand the utility of guest access for certain situations, and we are working hard to include this feature in our future updates.

To use the app the users are required to have an account specific to the tenant otherwise they would probably not be able to start a call with a user. 



## Multi tenants 

We'd like to inform you MetaOffice Pro currently does not support multi-tenant environments on Microsoft Teams. A multi-tenant environment refers to a situation where a user is part of multiple organizations or "tenants".

This is an important point to keep in mind as you set up and use our application. If you belong to multiple tenants, we recommend that you use MetaOffice Pro primarily on the tenant where you spend most of your time. 
If you try to use the application on many tenant at the same time you may experience some synchronization issues.
