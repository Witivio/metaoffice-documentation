# Available Features on MetaOffice Pro

## Out-of-meeting Interactions


 In the hallways, you can move freely and interact with other people by approaching them. Your camera and microphone will be activated, allowing you to start a conversation. To interact with a user, make sure to get closer to them without moving. Indeed, as soon as you move, the communication will be cut off.

 # Meeting rooms

 ## Interactions in Meeting Rooms


Meeting rooms are spaces specifically designed for collaborative work. You can access them by moving towards the door of the meeting room. Once inside, you can talk with your teammates and move freely in the space.

A meeting room is a place in which a meeting is created starting from two users being physically in the same room at the same time. As soon as there is only one user left in the room, the meeting is over.


## Meetings of Five or More
This feature is not hidden behind a button, but is rather a concept. Indeed, when you are in a meeting with more than six users (5 + you), the user who speaks the loudest will be propelled forward in the list of cameras. In meetings with more than six users, you will therefore have the opportunity to visualize all the participants when they speak.

## Join on Teams

MetaOffice Pro is fully integrated with Microsoft Teams and uses the same communication system. This is why it is possible to switch directly to Teams from MetaOffice Pro. Use this feature to share your screen or to use the Loop components.


## Conversation

The conversation button allows you to chat with your collaborators in text conversation. Take advantage of the available emotes and GIFs to interact with them. You can even continue this conversation outside of MetaOffice Pro, using your Microsoft Teams chat tab.





# Settings

## Device Configuration



Modify your device settings from the Settings menu, devices. Here you can choose the input device for your microphone and output for your speakers, as well as the camera devices you wish to use.

# General Features

## Users


The users panel allows you to see the people connected in the application. Just take a look at it to visualize your colleagues, their Office365 status. Take advantage of the "join" button to get to the selected player's position with one click. However, be careful, if the player moves while you have clicked to join them, we may not be able to bring you to their new position.



## Invite

Click on the "Invite" button and then select the recipients of your invitation. The recipients must have access to the channel in which the application is installed for it to be valid. Therefore, make sure to provide people who have access to the same environments as you.

With the invitation feature, the recipients will receive a link allowing them to go directly to the team where the application is installed. All that remains is to search for MetaOffice Pro and go to the application.


## Respawn

Thanks to this feature, there is no need to traverse the entire map when you connect. Go near a meeting room or right next to your workstation to select a new respawn location. On your next login, you will start at this location.

- Select "Respawn", "Create a respawn point" to configure a new point.

- Select "Respawn at default point" to return to the entrance of the map.

- Respawning at your point allows you to return to your favorite spot with one click.

## Focus

Use the "Focus" button to stay focused in the application. When this button is activated, you are cut off from interactions. Your camera and microphone are turned off and other players do not have the rights to enter into discussion with you. You can therefore use the "Focus" mode when you have something to do and you do not want to be disturbed.



## Reactions

This small menu allows you to use emotes. Feel free to use them in meetings or during relaxation moments.

## Conversation

The conversation button allows you to chat with your collaborators in a text conversation. Take advantage of the available emotes and GIFs to interact with them. You can use the "conversation" panel in several cases:

Outside of a meeting room or exchanging with a colleague: the discussion space will feed the conversation thread available in the team where MetaOffice Pro has been installed. You can therefore express yourself and be visible to all people who have access to the application.

Interacting with a colleague in and out of the meeting room: The discussion space feeds a private conversation between you. If a user joins you, the conversation history will not be disclosed. This new user will only have access to new messages since their arrival. If you leave MetaOffice, you still have the dedicated conversation tab in your Microsoft Teams conversations.

## Microphone & camera

The quick access Microphone and Camera buttons allow you to deactivate or activate these devices with one click. In this way, you can interact in the meeting room and take advantage of these options when it suits you.
