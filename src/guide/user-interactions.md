# Interactions

MetaOffice is a virtual workspace that allows users to interact and collaborate with their colleagues. Interactions are facilitated by the presence of 2D avatars that allow users to represent themselves virtually on a map.

## Interactions in Corridors Between users
To interact with another user in MetaOffice Pro, you need to be on a tile close to them. Once you are close, a video and voice communication between the two of you will start.

In  corridors, group communications are possible. The number of people who can participate in a conversation depends on how many people are adjacent to each other. For example, if three people are adjacent to each other, they can all communicate together at the same time.

It is important to note that in order for communications to proceed without interruption, it is recommended to remain still throughout the conversation. If you move, the communication will be interrupted. MetaOfficePro relies on principles of physical presence similar to the real world for corridor communications. If you are far away from your conversation partner, they will not be able to hear you.

Finally, to end a conversation, simply move away from the participants. You can simply move away from them to interrupt the communication.

## Interactions in Meeting Rooms
Interactions in meeting rooms are different from those in corridors. When you enter a meeting room, you will notice that the entire room is highlighted and the rest of the map is grayed out. This room is a meeting room, and it is possible to have a group conversation throughout the room. It is not necessary to be physically close to other participants as long as you remain in the room.

In a meeting room, it is also possible to collaborate with other users using presentation tools, virtual whiteboards, and other collaboration features. These tools can be used to facilitate discussion and group decision-making.
